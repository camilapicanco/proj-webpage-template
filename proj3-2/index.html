            <td>
                <img src="images/spheres_m_0.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption>M = 0</figcaption>

            <p>The image above only shows the light source because it has zero bounce. </p>

                <figcaption>M = 1</figcaption>
              </td>
              <p>The image above has one bounce. Now we can see the walls, floor and spheres shadows because
                of direct illumination. We can also see the reflection of the light on top of the two spheres
                after one bounce but this reflection is not the same on both spheres. This is because the sphere 
                on the right is also refractive and some of the rays enter the sphere, which leaves the light reflection on it 
                a little spotty. 
                 </p>

              </td>
              <p>The image above has two bounces. We can see the reflection of what the M=1 looked like inside the right and left sphere. But, 
                since the right sphere is also refractive, we only see the reflection of the rays that have not entered the sphere. This is why it is mostly black. </p>

              </td>
              <p>The image above has three bounces. We continue to see the same pattern for the left sphere, which reflects what
                M=2 looked like. But now the right sphere has changed, we can see that with three bounces the right sphere
                apperas to be glass. The rays enter the sphere, exit the sphere and bounce light off the floor. 
                We see the light refracted on the floor and the right blue wall on the left side of the sphere.</p>

              </td>
              <p>The image above has four bounces. The left sphere now show M=3, which includes the light bouncing off the floor.
                This light enters the right sphere and is refracted to the right wall.

              </td>
              <p>The above image has five bounces. The right side of the image appears to be the same has M=4. But the left 
                sphere is also reflecting the new light that appeared on the right wall when M=4. You can see a white dot in the 
            middle of the right sphere's reflection on the left sphere.</p>

        <div align="middle">

                <figcaption>M = 100</figcaption>
              </td>
              <p>The above image has 100 bounces. Other than a little more light spots on top of the right sphere, there is not much of a difference between this and the prevous image.
                Thus, the light reflections and refractions have converged.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 3. Environment Light</h3>
        <p> In the real world, when we take a picture of an object inside a church full of windows vs. inside a windowless dark room with a ceiling light, 
            we notice there is a difference in how lights are reflected by the object. This is because the object is receiving different types of light sources on 
            these different environments. Inside the church, the object would be receiving an infinite environment light, which is a light that provides radiance 
            to all directions of the object from an "infinitely far away" position. On the other hand, in the windowless dark room, the object would be receiving 
            only direct lighting.</p>
        <p> In this section of the project, we want to be able to render images with a realistic environment light as its light source. To do this we first choose
            a texture map to determine the intesity of the incoming light from each direction. Then, we sample from it using uniform sampling or importance sampling. </p>
        <p>We chose the grace.exr to be the environment map for our renderizations.</p>

        <p> For the bunny_unlit.dae and maxplanck.dae images above, we used 4 samples per pixel and 64 samples per light in each.
            The images on the left were rendered using uniform sampling and the images on the right were rendered using importance sampling.
            For both renderizations, we noticed that using uniform sampling results in a longer time for renderization and an image with 
            higher noise than importance sampling. This is because importance sampling converges faster than uniform since it samples around
            the light instead of the entire range.
